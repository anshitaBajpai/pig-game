## 🕹️ How to Play  
- The goal is to be the **first player to reach 100 points or more**.  
- On each turn, a player can:  
  1. **Roll the die**  
     - If the die shows **1**, the turn ends and no points are added.  
     - If the die shows **2–6**, that value is added to the player’s **turn total**.  
  2. **Hold**  
     - Add the **turn total** to the player’s overall score.  
     - End the turn and pass play to the next player.  

⚠️ Rolling a **1** means losing all points accumulated during that turn!
