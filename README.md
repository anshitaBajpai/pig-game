🎲 Pig Game

A simple dice game built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

🕹️ How to Play

The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points or more.

On each turn, a player can:

Roll the die

If the die shows 1, the turn ends and no points are added.

If the die shows 2–6, that value is added to the player’s turn total.

Hold

Add the turn total to the player’s overall score.

End the turn and pass play to the next player.

⚠️ Rolling a 1 means losing all points accumulated during that turn!
