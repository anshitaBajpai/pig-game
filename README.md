# How to play

The main objective of this game is that the first player has to reach a total score of 100 or more. In each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until dice shows 1  or the player decides to "hold" and end their turn.

If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they receive no points for the turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and they can choose to either roll again or hold. If they choose to hold, their turn total is added to their score, and the turn ends.
